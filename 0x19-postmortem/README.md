Title: Web Stack Outage Postmortem: Service Degradation and Slow Response Time

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 10, 2023, 2:00 PM to May 11, 2023, 6:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: Degraded performance and slow response time experienced by users; approximately 30% of users affected.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the web stack outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic and overload on specific backend servers.

Timeline:

Issue Detected: May 10, 2023, 2:15 PM (UTC); Monitoring system triggered an alert for increased latency and elevated error rates.
Actions Taken: The operations team started investigating the issue, initially assuming it to be a network connectivity problem. They checked the routers, switches, and network infrastructure for any potential issues.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: Due to the initial assumption of a network issue, the team spent several hours verifying network configurations and consulting with the network team, diverting attention from the root cause.
Escalation: After exhausting the network investigation, the incident was escalated to the development team for further analysis and troubleshooting.
Issue Resolution: May 11, 2023, 5:30 AM (UTC); The development team identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings as the root cause and promptly applied the necessary changes to restore normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration in the load balancer, resulting in an uneven distribution of traffic. Some backend servers were overwhelmed, leading to degraded performance and slow response times. To resolve the issue, the development team adjusted the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across all available backend servers. This ensured balanced workloads and improved overall system performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve Monitoring: Enhance the monitoring system to proactively detect and alert for abnormal traffic patterns, latency spikes, and error rates.
Task: Implement additional monitoring metrics for load balancing and backend server performance.
Load Balancer Configuration Review: Regularly review and validate load balancer configurations to ensure optimal traffic distribution.
Task: Conduct a comprehensive audit of load balancer configurations and verify their alignment with best practices.
Automated Load Testing: Establish a load testing framework to simulate various traffic scenarios and assess system performance under stress.
Task: Develop automated load tests that simulate peak traffic loads and validate load balancing effectiveness.
Incident Response Training: Provide training to the operations and development teams on effective incident response protocols and best practices.
Task: Conduct incident response workshops to educate teams on proper troubleshooting techniques and escalation procedures.
Documentation Update: Maintain up-to-date documentation on system architecture, configurations, and troubleshooting steps for future reference.
Task: Revise the documentation to include load balancer configuration guidelines and troubleshooting procedures


By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the stability, performance, and resilience of our web stack, ensuring a seamless user experience and minimizing the risk of similar incidents in the future.

In conclusion, the web stack outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to degraded performance and slow response times. Through diligent investigation and the application of corrective measures, we resolved the issue and implemented preventative actions to mitigate the risk of recurrence. We remain committed to continuous improvement and proactive monitoring to deliver reliable and efficient services to our users.
